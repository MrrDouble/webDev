<div class="lyrics"> <i><b> [Intro: Swae Lee] </b><br>
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh) <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh) <br>
Ayy, ayy <br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 1: Swae Lee]</b> <br>
Needless to say, I keep her in check<br> 
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)<br>
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)<br>
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)<br>
<br>

Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check <br>
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless <br>
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck <br>
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck <br>
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip <br>
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip <br>
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt <br>
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt <br>
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse <br>
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose <br>
<br>

<b>[Chorus: Swae Lee] </b> <br>
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya  <br>
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much <br>
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya  You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower  <br> 
<br>
<b>[Verse 2: Post Malone] </b> <br>
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (Ooh), you don't make it easy, no (No, no) <br>
Wish I could be there for ya (Ooh), give me a reason to (Oh) <br>
Every time I'm walkin' out (Oh), I can hear you tellin' me to turn around (Oh, oh) <br>
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down (No) <br>
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (Now) <br>
<br>
I know you're scared of the unknown (-Known) <br>
You don't wanna be alone (Alone) <br>
I know I always come and go (And go) <br>
But it's out of my control  <br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus: Post Malone] </b> <br>
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya <br>
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much <br>
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya <br>
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower, yeah<br></i>
